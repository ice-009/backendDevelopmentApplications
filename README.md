Assignment: Simple Backend API Development with TypeScript

Duration: 3-4 days

Instructions: Welcome to our Simple Backend API Development assignment! In this task, you will build a basic RESTful API backend using Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript, and a lightweight database. This project aims to assess your skills in setting up a backend server and handling API requests with strict typing.

Task: You are required to create a backend web application that provides API endpoints to interact with a simple "To-Do List" application. The frontend (To-Do List app) will be built separately and will communicate with your backend through the provided API endpoints. The backend should allow users to create, retrieve, update, and delete tasks from their to-do list.

Approach: I have first created back-end using node ts and mongodb(as i haven't used the sqlite yet). Then i learnt sqlite from youtube and ediited the code made schema in sqlite and then made the whole back-end ready and deployed api end points. Then I shifted to frontend made the api fetching and made whole frontend ready.

Difficulty: Learning SQLITE  was the most difficult task and making documentation for the first time was also felt challenging.
